<h2>THE BUILD</h2>
<p>Kircheis shard should be rushed every game.</p>            <img src="bard img/kshard.jpg">
<p>If you are going traditional build 1st item is Night Harvester, but if not then Rod of Ages also works.</p><img src="bard img/harvester.jpg">          <img src="bard img/roa.jpg">
<p>2nd item should be Rapid Firecannon for auto attack strength, but I also like Nashor's Tooth even though it is a much weaker option.</p><img src="bard img/rfc.jpg">          <img src="bard img/nash tooth.jpg">
<p>3rd and 4th items are situational but Demonic Embrace is a solid option.</p><img src="bard img/dem embrace.jpg">
<p>Boots are nearly always Boots of Swiftness, but can be situational.</p><img src="bard img/swift.jpg">
<p>Support item is 100% of the time Spellthief's Edge.</p><img src="bard img/spellthief.jpg">
<h2>THE RUNES</h2>
<p>These are the main rune pages:</p>
<img src="bard img/elec insp rune.jpg">
<p>Inspiration rune is for snowballing and resolve against hard cc/hook champs in early game.</p>
<img src="bard img/elec res rune.jpg">
<p>Hail of Blades can also work but is much better for AD Bard.</p>
<h2>THE PLAYSTYLE</h2>
<p>FULL DMG BARD Support is a high damaging support/jungle hybrid build that is also great for supporting due to Bard's crowd control abilities. This build trades defence for offence and because of that is much different thaan the usual build.<br>Level 1 Bard is very strong so look for Q or flash Q angles. This is only possible level 1.<br>Try collecting as many chimes as possible and ganking other lanes often with your E. Chimes in lane are for mana and chimes in jungle and other lanes should be collected as soon as possible.<br>Every five chimes you gain a damage buff to your meeps so try collecting chimes before big teamfights.<br>Meeps are your main source of damage so don't waste them on minions or jungle camps before fights since they take a few seconds to regenerate. Q and one auto procs Electrocute.<br>Lastly, play FULL DMG BARD as a second jungler, so gank as much as you can while keeping your adc alive, providing vision, collecting chimes, getting kills and snowballing.</p>
